## My process
I wanted a simple project to start practicing Tailwind CSS with, and this challenge was the best one to start with. The design was minimal, so it was perfect.
What I Did:
* I first added the CDN link for Tailwind
* Then got the links for the font family on Google fonts
* Since the challenge was a simple card component, I started by making a parent div to position the card to the center of the page.
* Then I used the materials given to build the project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I recently just started learning Tailwind CSS and I am glad to note that it made it easy to quickly build this project.

### Continued development

I would like to learn how to make my own custom breakpoints in Tailwind and how to make reuseable components too, I believe these would improve my skills and proficiency using Tailwind CSS
